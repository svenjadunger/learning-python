# parts computer
# brain = cpu - pieces hardware, respond to instructions
# memory is RAM - where your game is stored while its being used, 
# algorithm list of instructions to tell people what to do (step by step instructions)
# 

#flowchart, flow diagram, pseudocode

#flowchart graphical representation of an algorithm
#uses formally standard symbols connected by lines with arrows to show the flow


#starting point or ending point -  start
#parallelogramm input or output from the process with the algorithm zb input 
#4eck process that is performed within the algorithm  zb cashback = 0 set it to 0
#route indicaes selection or decesion within the algorithn zb if purchcadr > 500
# -> locacial flow algorithm

#Beispiel: Algorithm to add two numbers 10 and 20
# number 1 = 10, number 2 = 20
#add number 1 and number 2

#kreis Start -> 4eck number 1=10 -> 4eck number 2= 20 -> add number 1 and number 2 -> parralelogram Output answer -> kreis End
# kreis start -> parallelogramm input number 1 -> parall. input number 2 -> route is number 1 >= 2 -> pfeil nach li. true, pfeil na. re. false -> v
# von pfeil true -> substract number 2 from number 1 -> pfeil von false: subtract number 1 from number2
# pfeile gehen zusammen -> 4eck store answer as number 3 -> parallel. ourtput number 3 -> kreis End


#Pseudocode

# resemles closely to programming language but is not a programming language
# doesnt run on a computer, needs to be converted in a programming language
#different variations, should be easy to follow


#Beispiel: Algorithm to add two numbers 10 and 20
# number 1 = 10, number 2 = 20
#add number 1 and number 2


#vartiable is named as a single word
# FirstName zb name oder first_Name
# number1 <-10 or number1= 10 or SET number1 to 10
#answer <- number1+ number 2 or answer = number1 + number2 or SET answer to SUM of number1 and number2
# OUTPUT answer or SEND answer to DISPLAY
#

#IF THEN ELSE STATEMENTS

# number 1 <- USERINPUT
# number2 <- USERINPUT
# IF number1 >= number 2 THEN
# answer <- number1 - number2
# ELSE
#answer <- number 2-number1
#ENDIF 
# number3 <- answer
#OUTPUT number3
